## How to Use

### Option 1: Use the New Structure (Recommended ⭐)
```bash
# Use index.html as your new entry point
# All external files load automatically
# Same functionality, better organization
```

### Option 2: Keep Both (Safe)
```bash
# Keep page.html as backup/reference
# Use index.html as primary
# Delete page.html once verified
```

## What's Preserved

✅ All Framer functionality
✅ All styles and appearance
✅ All JavaScript behavior
✅ All font loading
✅ All responsive design
✅ All performance optimizations
✅ All internal links

---

## What's Different
